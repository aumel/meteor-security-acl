## Code style

**Note:** Actually, the code style is tested only on `src` directory of SecurityAcl.


Use JSHint to check the code style (read `.jshintrc` file).

JSHint is published to npm, the package manager for the Node.js. You may install JSHint globally using the following command:
```sh
$ npm install -g jshint
```

To check code style of SecurityAcl, use the following command:
```sh
$ jshint src
```
